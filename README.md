üåü Introduction

Born2beroot is a system administration project from 42 School. The goal of this project is to create a secure virtual machine using Debian or Rocky within a virtual environment like VirtualBox or UTM.

üîç What You'll Do:

‚úÖ Set up user privileges and security measures

‚úÖ Configure SSH access and firewall rules

‚úÖ Set up password policies and sudo configuration

‚úÖ Monitor system resources and automate services


This README will guide you through the setup process step-by-step to help you build a functional and secure server environment.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

### What is a Virtual Machine? <a name="what-is-a-virtual-machine"></a>
A Virtual Machine (VM) is software that emulates a complete computer system, allowing you to run an operating system within your current OS. It provides virtualized hardware to the guest OS.

### How do Virtual Machines work? <a name="how-do-virtual-machines-work"></a>
VMs work through a hypervisor that allocates physical resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to virtual environments. The hypervisor manages these resources between the host system and guest VMs.

### What is LVM? <a name="what-is-lvm"></a>
Logical Volume Manager (LVM) provides flexible disk management by abstracting physical storage into volume groups that can be dynamically allocated to logical volumes.

### What is AppArmor? <a name="what-is-apparmor"></a>
AppArmor is a Linux security module that confines programs to a limited set of resources using profile-based mandatory access control.

### Difference between Apt and Aptitude <a name="difference-between-apt-and-aptitude"></a>
APT (Advanced Package Tool) is Debian's package management system, while Aptitude is a text-based interface to APT with additional features like dependency resolution.

### How to use SSH? <a name="how-to-use-ssh"></a>
SSH (Secure Shell) allows secure remote access to systems. Basic usage:
```bash
ssh username@hostname -p port
