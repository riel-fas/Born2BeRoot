1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

Born2beroot is a system administration project from 42 School. The goal of this project is to create a secure virtual machine using Debian or Rocky within a virtual environment like VirtualBox or UTM.

üîç What You'll Do:

‚úÖ Set up user privileges and security measures

‚úÖ Configure SSH access and firewall rules

‚úÖ Set up password policies and sudo configuration

‚úÖ Monitor system resources and automate services


This README will guide you through the setup process step-by-step to help you build a functional and secure server environment.

What is a Virtual Machine? <a name="what-is-a-virtual-machine"></a>

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based computer that runs an operating system (OS) inside another OS, using shared hardware resources (CPU, RAM, storage).

Key Properties:

‚û°Ô∏è Hypervisor: Software (e.g., VirtualBox, UTM) that creates/manages VMs.

‚û°Ô∏è Isolation: VM crashes won‚Äôt affect the host machine.

‚û°Ô∏è Snapshots: Save/restore VM state at any point.


Types of VMs:

‚û°Ô∏è Type 1 (Bare-metal): Runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi).

‚û°Ô∏è Type 2 (Hosted): Runs on top of an OS (e.g., VirtualBox).


Why Use VMs?

‚úî Test software safely

‚úî Run multiple OSes (Linux/Windows/macOS) on one machine

‚úî Clone/backup entire systems

How do Virtual Machines work? <a name="how-do-virtual-machines-work"></a>

Virtual Machines (VMs) operate through a hypervisor, which acts as a mediator between physical hardware and virtual environments.


‚ñ∂Ô∏è Core Mechanism:

Resource Allocation: The hypervisor partitions CPU, RAM, and storage from the host machine. Each VM gets virtualized hardware (vCPU, virtual RAM, virtual disks).

Isolation: VMs run independently‚Äîa crash in one VM doesn‚Äôt affect others or the host.

Communication: The hypervisor translates VM requests into physical hardware instructions.



‚ñ∂Ô∏è Key Advantages:

Efficiency: Maximizes hardware usage.

Security: Malware in a VM won‚Äôt infect the host.

Portability: VMs can be moved between physical servers.

What is LVM? <a name="what-is-lvm"></a>

Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is an advanced storage management system that provides flexible disk partitioning beyond traditional methods.


Core Components:

   \Physical Volume (PV): 
    
   - Actual storage devices (HDDs, SSDs, partitions)
    
   - Initialized with pvcreate /dev/sdX

   \Volume Group (VG): 
    
   - Pool of PVs that form shared storage
     
   - Created with vgcreate vg_name /dev/sdX

   \Logical Volume (LV):

   - Virtual partitions created from VG space

   - Made with lvcreate -L 10G -n lv_name vg_name


Advantages Over Traditional Partitioning:

   ‚úîDynamic resizing without unmounting

   ‚úîCombined storage from multiple disks

   ‚úîLive snapshots for backups

   ‚úîEasy storage migration

What is AppArmor? <a name="what-is-apparmor"></a>

AppArmor (Application Armor) is a Linux security module that implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC) to restrict programs' capabilities through security profiles.


Key Features:

‚ñ∂Ô∏èProfile-based protection: Each application runs with explicitly defined permissions

‚ñ∂Ô∏èTwo enforcement modes:

   Enforce: Actively blocks unauthorized actions

   Complain: Logs violations without blocking (learning mode)

‚ñ∂Ô∏èPath-based controls: Restricts access to files, network ports, and capabilities


How It Works:

   *Ô∏è‚É£ System administrator creates security profiles for applications

   *Ô∏è‚É£ AppArmor intercepts system calls and checks them against profiles

   *Ô∏è‚É£ Violations are either blocked or logged based on mode
